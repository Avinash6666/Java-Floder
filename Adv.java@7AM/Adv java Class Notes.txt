                                            Adv.java Class Notes                       
                                         =========================
--> Similarly we need to run an web application we need on server.
-->They are diff servers are there in market. For Example
        apache tomcat
        glassfish
        web sphere
        web logic

--> web.xml is called as deployment descriptor

--> If you want to run an application we have to select Run on server

--> If you want to excute a server on bowser we have to now the port name Or IP address--> this is the ip Address(http://localhost:8080/FirstwebApplcation/index.html)

* Diff b/w web Application & standalone java program in that, javaSE is used to Write the core java program which has the main method, but in web Application
   there is no main method. JavaEE is used to create the web based Application

* If you want to bulid a Web Application we need one software that is eclipse

* While downloading eclipse we need to select java EE to build Web Application 

* In order to work or create the web Application we need to download one server 

* After install server we need to go server window, select new server, select the apachetomcat 8.5 or any update version and click on download & install option

* Once it install click on the check box for generating the web.xml

* In order to create web Application select the -> Dynamic web Module-> & enter the project Name

* When we are going to create a new package we have to select src (click on right button & select package option)

* After create package we need to create class.  Right Click on that package and go to others option & select it 
   After selecting that we need to select server option and create a class

* When we are going to create a new servlet automatically in web.xml create a new servlet
   for exp: We create a new package like com.ashokit.firstweb
            in that we create a one class like FirstServer
			in that like below code automatically it create in web.xml
			<servlet>
		<servlet-name>FirstServlet</servlet-name>
		<display-name>FirstServlet</display-name>
		<description></description>
		<servlet-class>com.ashokit.firstweb.FirstServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>FirstServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/FirstServlet</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
	
* When we are going to access the firstservlet we need to access the url of firstservelt
  if we want display in cmd we need to write the sopln
  if we want to display on bowser we need o write the code 
     printwriter writer = respone.getwriter();
	 writer.write("hi this is secondservlet")   (Or) response.getWriter().append("Served at: ").append(request.getContextPath());
	 if we want to access doget() or dopost() we have one shortcut form (ctrl+space)
	if we want to access a servlet on bower with heilp this code we can acccess(http://localhost:8080/FirstwebApplcation/FirstServlet?userName=%22123%22&password=%22sdf%22)
if you want to open any floder in elipse we have one shortcut key (crt+shift+h)

* if we want change the servlet name we can change no issue will happen automatically it will access

* We can deploy multiple servers in one Application

* If you want to implement or extend a sever we must import the server with the help of (ctrl+shift+o) then only add unimplementation will be visable

Q) What Is a Servlet?
A) A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that 
   host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q) Servlet Life Cycle
A) The life cycle of a servlet is controlled by the container in which the servlet has been deployed. When a request is mapped to a servlet, the container performs the following steps.

   1)If an instance of the servlet does not exist, the web container

	a)Loads the servlet class.

	b)Creates an instance of the servlet class.

	c)Initializes the servlet instance by calling the init method. Initialization is covered in Initializing a Servlet.

   2)Invokes the service method, passing request and response objects. Service methods are discussed in Writing Service Methods.

Q) What is JSP and why it is used?
A) It stands for Java Server Pages.It is used for creating web application.It is used to create dynamic web content. 
   In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages.It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology.
   It is a Web based technology helps us to create dynamic and platform independent web pages. The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q) How many implicit objects are there in JSP?
A) 9 jsp implicit objects
   There are 9 jsp implicit objects. These objects are created by the web container that are available to all the jsp pages. 
   The available implicit objects are out, request, config, session, application etc.
