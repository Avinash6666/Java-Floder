//Develop a program to create RWO student in pw as part of Ashok IT Studen information maintanece System(NSIMS)
//Store sno,sname,course and fee of each Student
//Display all values on console as we print on ID card

//In this project we must create two classes
//  1)Student -> for storing creating instanced and storing student values
//  2)collage-->  for storing creating main mehod,creating instances and running project


//we can also create main method directly in class Student and w
//we can create instance of Student class directly in class Student
//but it wrong code pratice ,because a product
//is manufacture for other objects not for same object


class Student{

int sno;
String sname;

double fee;
